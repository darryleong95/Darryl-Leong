I spent the summer surrounded with brilliant Engineers who were extremely well versed in their domain. The talks and networking sessions organized has also taught me a lot about the complexities and challenges of a financial instituition. I am tremendously grateful for this opportunity as it has helped me build my confidence in both my technical and non-technical competencies."

During my time, I was given the chance to learn from various Engineers while working on the 3rd Generation of the Singtel app. In these months, I helped with maintaining the existing application as well as writing scripts to better facillitate and automate progress tracking for the team. Getting the exposure and opportunity to speak to senior management in this programme has also allowed me to better understand the inner workings and the vastness of Singtel's business"
